# Blockbuster Employee Management System


## Description
This project is a management system for the Blockbuster video rental store that can be extended or altered to fit the needs of other rental stores. It is created using wxWidgets, C++, and MYSQL. The management system includes self-management, which is the ability for an employee to manage a limited set of their own information. This might include address, gender, age, profile picture, and other information. 


## Features
The management system will include multiple functions for separate users depending on their level of management. These include the ability for a base store employee to enter and edit various demographic information, as well as view their work schedule and request days off. Also included is the ability for store managers to have access to greater access and control to make schedule edits, write performance reviews about employees that only managers are allowed to view.
