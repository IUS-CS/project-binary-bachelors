  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * Completed work. We do well with our roles and getting things done on time.
  
  
  ### Bad
  
  * Meetings aren't happening all that often due to scheduling conflicts and lack of notifications. 
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a team, we will design a checklist of things to discuss during meetings and document what happens more fully.
  * As a team, we will make sure everybody knows what they should be doing from the beginning of each sprint.

  -------|--------
  5      | As a user, I want to be able to edit my personal records if I need to for future payments.
  8      | As an administrator, I want to be a be able to add and delete employees starting at least 30 days after termination so I can keep the employee records looking clean.
