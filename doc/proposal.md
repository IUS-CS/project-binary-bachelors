# Blockbuster Employee Management Project

## Description
> This project will store, edit, and manage employee information for blockbuster video and include login for current employees and handle registration for new employees. The employee could do things like manage their information or accounts, apply for promotions, or give their two week's notice. It will include employee details like allergy info, hire date, PTO, etc. The higher up the ladder the more the employee can do.

## Installation Instructions
> Download the zip file (yet to be committed), which includes the necessary code and wxWidget files (gui) for building the project. Load the project into your favorite IDE, setup the wxWidget files in the IDE (more instructions on this to come), and build it. 

## Project Vision
> The vision of this project is for it to work as a legitimate and fully functional employee management system for Blockbuster Video (or any other video/game rental store). This system should be one that will be implemented into a website or can easily be implemented in this way from the code available. By "fully functional", we mean that the system should closely follow the project description above, be easily updatable,
