# The Legend of Zordo Project

## Description
> This project is a virtual game in which you take control of a character and use this character to solve a maze of randomly generated rooms and fight enemies along the way. The floor you play on will have a random layout of preselected rooms. Each time you start a new instance of the game it will be separate from the one you played before, ensuring the challenges will always remain fresh and intriguing.
> 

## Installation Instructions
> Download SDL2, SDL 2 Image, and the folder which includes the necessary game textures for building the project. Load the project into your favorite IDE, setup the SDL2, and SDL 2 Image in the IDE (more instructions on this to come), and build it.
> 

## Project Vision
> The vision of this project is for it to work as a fully functional game with all the various elements we wish to include, such as enemies, various room layouts, and most importantly, random floor pattern generation. By "fully functional", we mean that the game should closely follow the project description above, be easily updatable, and work without any game altering bugs. This game should be able to be loaded and build in any IDE with the necessary downloads and setup listed previously.
