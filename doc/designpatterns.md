#Design Patterns

##Introduction

In Legend of Zordo, we've come up with various ideas and are currently using (I think) two of the design patterns listed: which are the prototype and the object pool. Some monsters might use the same prototype, but have special concrete features such as being enraged or slip accross mud. Others might just need to be pluckef from a pool of monster objects with no added features.

##Future Design Patterns

Some other patterns that might be good to use for the future include decorator, composite, and iterator.

##Modules

The modules that we design using these patterns above will be done one at a time in the order of importance or priority.
