  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * Completed work. 
  
  
  ### Bad
  
  * Meetings aren't happening all that often due to scheduling conflicts and lack of notifications. 
  * Responsibilities have been a bit of a problem since they are not metted out early in the sprints. 
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a team, we will design a checklist of things to discuss during meetings and document what happens more fully.
  * As a team, we will make sure everybody knows what they should be doing from the beginning of each sprint.
