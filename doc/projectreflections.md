# Project Reflections

## Christopher Pruett
My experience with this project was mostly good and it taught me a few lessons. Regular and early sprint meetings are essential for the project as a whole. It's necessary for assigning general roles and responsibilites and creating the necessary backlogs for efficient and reasonable workloads. We all had different schedules, so this was a tough one throughout the semester, but the times we did follow through with good meetings we got more done and were less stressed about what each of us had to do and what was going to get done.
